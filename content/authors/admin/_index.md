# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I am a medical doctor currently integrated in the Centre of Statistics and its Applications at the University of Lisbon. During my time in medical school,
I received training in Statistics and Epidemiology having participated in several research projects. I have also invested in self-learning using various internet resources and books in order
to gain skills that are not typical in medical school. I was also a fellow in Clinical Research at the Netherlands Institute for Health Sciences ESP. Currently, I am also undertaking the MIT micromasters in Statistics and Data Science.
I have 4 years of experience in both R and Python and enjoy having chances to use programming to solve problems in healthcare and associated fields.
